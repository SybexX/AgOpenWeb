/// <summary>
/// Single entry point for pointing AGOPENWEB_DATA at a location Android will let us use
/// without root or any user-granted permission, on every supported version (API 23+).
///
/// Called from <c>AndroidApp.OnCreate</c>, which Android runs before any Activity or Service in
/// the process (including a sticky <c>BackendService</c> restart without <c>MainActivity</c>),
/// so it happens before anything touches <see cref="AppDataRoot.Documents"/>. The env var is set
/// once per process and never changed afterward, so a mid-life move that would strand
/// already-loaded data can't happen.
///
/// On first run after upgrading from the old MyDocuments-based layout, an existing
/// MyDocuments/AgOpenWeb folder is copied (never moved — a failure part-way through can't
/// lose the source) into the new root, then a marker file stops it running again. The copy
/// skips files that already exist, so a retry after an interrupted copy fills in only what's
/// missing and never overwrites anything.
